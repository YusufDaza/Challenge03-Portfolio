# Password Generator App

## Description
I developed this project as part of a challenge to create a browser-based application that allows employees to generate random passwords based on their selected criteria. The application boasts a responsive and polished user interface, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes.

- **Motivation:**  To enhance user security by providing a tool for generating strong, randomized passwords.
- **Why:** To create a practical and user-friendly password generator that meets the needs of employees.
- **Problem Solving:** Addresses the challenge of creating strong, varied passwords for increased security.
- **What I Learned:** Improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly in handling user input and dynamically updating the interface.
